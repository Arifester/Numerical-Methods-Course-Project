# Numerical Methods Course Project
This repository is a Numerical Methods course project that contains a web application to solve non-linear equations using the Secant method.
This application allows users to enter a function, initial guess, tolerance limit, and maximum number of iterations, then displays the iteration results and a solution convergence graph.
